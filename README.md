NSOutlineViewLazinessDemo
=========================

Demonstrates how NSOutlineView is not lazy when expanding items, and how to work around the issue by using a lazy data source.

Instructions:

* Build and run the project.  An window with two outline views will appear.
* Watch the console.
* In the "Dumb" outline view, click the disclosure triangle, to expand "Mother", and note how long it takes.
* Repeat for the "Lazy" outline view.
